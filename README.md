## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Async Functions

### What I learned

I used asyncronous functions and fetch quite a bit in this project. I learned how to get a clients ip address with JS as well.

### Continued development

I will continue to get better with CSS Grid in future projects. I feel much more comfortable with Flexbox, but really learning how to use the two in conjuction with each other is my goal.
